# TODO: Improve Service Images Appearance

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Ensure all service cards use consistent product-slider structure
- [x] Enhance CSS styling for better image appearance in style.css
- [x] Test the services page to ensure images load properly and have good appearance
- [x] Verify slider functionality works for multi-image services
